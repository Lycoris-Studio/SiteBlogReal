Hi, since you are reading this you are probably well aware we have a blog now. After all you are reading a blog post currently.

I promise we will have a blog post soon (hopefully by the next time you come back here) about our current projects and when that comes this post will disappear.

Anyway since you are early here's some random info:

- This site is a github pages thing
- the lycoris icon here is blue because thats what we use for internal/development stuff (i think)
- lycoris only has people with first names that begin with J, K or L currently.
- JAM will have a demo
